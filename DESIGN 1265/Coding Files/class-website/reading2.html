    <h1>Reading Response: "The New Turing Test"</h1>
    <p>
        The article by Alan Ullendorff focuses on redefining the Turing Test. The test seeks to “determine a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human” (Ullendorff 2). When redefining the test in the context of the modern age of AI, the writer highlights that asking questions such as “Is it AI-generated?” or “How much of a piece of work is AI-generated?” misplaces people’s focus regarding the issue of AI’s humanity. To resolve these questions, Ullendorff lays out the following set of standards: “From someone, for someone, in a particular context” (Ullendorff 3). He advises that people should use the three prompts to determine if an original piece has been accomplished, which can help people distinguish what is human or not. Reframing how people should assess a piece of work raises the standards for AI. Resetting a higher goal post allows for a barrier that weakens the AI threat, as it demands more complex capabilities that AI would need to successfully impersonate human creativity.

        I agree with most of this article, and it surprisingly gave me comfort in knowing that AI may not be as close to replacing creative media as I thought. It is quite difficult to replicate the human-to-human connections that stem from original art, especially since AI’s nature is to take common creative practices and bundle them all into one absurdity. Therefore, Ullendorff’s assumption that he would never have to question any of his students for using AI if they can accomplish his three guidelines is not so far off. However, one area where I disagree with the writer is that the perspective is heavily outcome-focused. It only analyzes works after they have been made and shared without any context of the process. Human work should not only be defined by the result. The process of how they come to be is the most human part about it, from inspiration and planning to the translation and execution. The artistic journey is filled with choices that human judgment determines, which is something AI lacks with its ten-second loading screen.

        Who knows? Perhaps AI can eventually become deceiving enough to accomplish all three areas that Ullendorff had described. Currently, that is not the case. However, it is not entirely impossible that near-future AI can potentially create distinct styles that connect people in the right context. Like human artists who take inspiration from a wide range of people when exploring individual style, AI could do the same once it is advanced enough. From there, the only defining factor between human and AI artists would be the creation process, something that should be included in the new Turing Test.
