    <h1>Reading Response: "Restaurant Websites"</h1>
    <p>
        Toph Tucker and Jasmine Lee write about how restaurant websites are an informational source that captures a piece of a restaurant’s personality into an online form. They state that the practice of creating such websites is dated, yet serves as a charming source of the old technological world, leaving an impression that the audience can expect before physically entering a restaurant. The writers review several websites that function uniquely and take note of how the best restaurant websites are able to translate the physical space into the online world through text-use, color palette, geometric shapes, and accessibility tailored toward the specific restaurant. An example is Kajitsu, a Japanese restaurant that emphasizes seasonality. The layout is simple with a refined, dated newspaper style, which captures the restaurant’s sleek and retro atmosphere (as seen in the photo). To capture seasonality, the website regularly updates the menu each year and preserves an archive of past food served throughout the years, contributing to the restaurant’s pride in honoring the recent past.

        However, Tucker and Lee pose interesting commentary on how recent technologies have shifted the existence of restaurant websites and how a restaurant’s creative individualism dwindles through the use of social media or templated tools. Both understand that the rise of social media persists through its conventional nature as well as the fact that website developers are awarded slim margins and hiring capacity within the industry. Tucker and Lee are not completely opposed to digital tools creating more access to larger audiences and simplifying code. However, they wish for tools to enable more creative expression rather than offer formatted constraints on how a restaurant presents itself. It was interesting to read about hope for a middle-ground solution, advocating for restaurants to depend less on social media to convey the mood and spirit. Lee predicts that restaurant websites may morph into blogging rather than parked websites. As a reader, I agree that current trends may accommodate a blogging culture that can maintain the older style of expressive web design. Social media limits a restaurant’s capabilities and may not adapt as well to shifting menus or certain aspects of a restaurant’s culture. Meanwhile, experimenting with text, tone, animation, and imagery can highlight a restaurant’s value and capture a larger picture. However, greater expression can only be brought out when restaurant managers are given tools that allow for the right levels of accessibility and innovation. Perhaps, social media channels can begin adopting Canva or Adobe-like features into their apps to make such outcomes possible, while retaining a larger and more productive network.
